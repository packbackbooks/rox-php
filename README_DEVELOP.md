## Development

### Prerequisites

Install `composer` using these guidelines: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md.

After installation proceed to the project root directory and run

```
composer install
```  

### Tests

From the project root run

```
composer install
composer test
```

### Running Demo Server

Demo uses the following environment variables defined in the system:

 - `ROLLOUT_API_KEY`
 - `ROLLOUT_DEV_MOD_KEY`
 
These variables can be set before run. To start demo server at `localhost:8080` run

```
composer run demo
```

### Release new version
- create a branch
- update version name (semver) in /src/Rox/Core/Client/DeviceProperties.php
- merge to master (make sure unit tests and E2E tests are passing)
- create a new github release, use branch `master` and add a `tag` with the version name (same semver from DeviceProperties.php)
- go to packagist https://packagist.org/packages/rollout/rox, and click `update` (you will only see action buttons if you are logged in, and a maintainer of this package, if you are not, please ask from one of the maintainers on the right panel to add you)
- make sure the new version shows with the right version name
- (run E2E tests using this new version)

one day hopefully we'll have a script
